# This repository is created for Makefile cheat sheet purposes

1) Example1 - simplest make file
2) Example2 - Including subdirectiories / headers etc.
3) Example3 - Including libraries
   1. building and linking static library (.a)
   2. building and linking dynamic library (.so)
   3. building and linking dynamic and static library together
      1) shared lib using static library
      2) static lib is using shared library
      3) executable is simply linked with static and shared library
4) Example4 - All in together, and avoid recompilation and also triggering running submake
